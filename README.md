In today’s world, credit cards are the one of the most used payment methods. To customers, credit cards offer a way to conserve 
cash in hand and a period of time to buy goods without a psychological barrier of over-purchasing goods. To banks, the credit cards
providers, credit cards offers profits provided the credit card holders pay their bills in timely fashion. According to an article
published in the Forbes magazine, the credit card holders who pay their bills mostly on time but who don’t pay in full are the most
valuable customers. Therefore, credit card providers are always on a search for valuable customers to whom they can advertise their
credit cards and whom they can convince to buy their cards. In order to make their search for these valuable customers easier, theses
credit card providers collect a variety of information about their customers. This is a marketing strategy used by most credit card
providers. The objective of this project is to predict whether a customer would get a new credit card based on the information 
collected about him/her.
